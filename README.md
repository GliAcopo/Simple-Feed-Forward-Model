# Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network in C  

## Description  

This project provides a foundational implementation of a feed-forward neural network using the C programming language and principles of graph theory. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how such models operate by constructing one from the ground up.  

The [Documentation.odt](Documentation.odt) file serves as a comprehensive guide to the programâ€™s internal mechanics. Since the project's main purpose is educational, the documentation includes detailed commentary on the design decisions made throughout the development process.
