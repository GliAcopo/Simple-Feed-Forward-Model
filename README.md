# Simple Feed Forward Neural Network in C

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of a feed-forward neural network using the C language and graph theory. The main goal is to learn how these models work by building one from scratch.
Note that the comments I write on my code are probably more complete and descriptive than this README.

## Features

- **Feed Forward Architecture:** Data flows from input to output (still in progress).
- **Graph Representation:** Uses adjacency matrices to represent node connections.
- **Activation Functions:** Includes basic activation functions (like Sigmoid).


This project is part of my learning journey with C programming and neural networks. The code is still under development and might not follow best practices. 

**Feedback and suggestions are welcome!**
